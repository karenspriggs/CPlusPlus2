# C++ Programming 2
This repository holds my assignments for C++ programming 2, which includes the following projects:

## Euchre
This application simulates a hundred games of Euchre and keeps track of how many times each of the two teams won. Each game is represented by an instance of the match class, and the entirety of the game's flow is covered in the simulation. Players act depending on the rules of the game and how their teammates + opponents have played up to that point.

## CafePOS
This project is a console application that simulates ordering something from a cafe, which includes showing a menu, taking the user's order, printing a receipt, and giving them the correct change with the fewest coins.

## CSV Parser
This project is a parser created for a C++ programming class that takes in a CSV file, specifically that which contains data for restaurant inspections, and maps this data to classes for analysis later. Once the CSV file is parsed, the program groups the cases by zip code and then orders the set by number of failures. Sets with the same number of failures are ordered by the date of their last failed inspection.
